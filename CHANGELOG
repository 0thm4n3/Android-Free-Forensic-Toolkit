 afft (0.02-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * AFFT now detects the OS it is run on, and changes it's available options appropriately
  * Importing of image files acquired through other means is now supported.
  * Extracting data from Google Maps, Google Calendar API and AOSP Email is now supported
  * AFFT can now break screenlocks; be aware this is a last-resort tool
  * The AFFT case file structure is no longer limited to the home directory, and is now user-configurable. Great for Live-CD use.
  * AFFT now asks for root access upfront
  * Extraction on Windows and OSX is now possible with the help of third party mounting tools.
